    "*input:*  \n",
    "Get data from the keyboard, a file, the network, or some other device.\n",
    "\n",
    "*output:*  \n",

    "Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look pretty much like these.

    "It has already been mentioned that APL is a bit different to other languages. This course is not going to teach you *computer science per se*. APL has a more mathematical flavour than other languages. You will not learn much about [data types]() or [memory management](), since these are handled by the APL interpreter. Instead, APL focuses on elegantly converting *problem solutions* into *executable code*. APL is actually a mathematical language for expressing algorithms, not just *A Programming Language*.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is not to say that APL is useless to aspiring or professional computer scientists. Quite the contrary, learning to think in an *array-oriented* way can be invaluable when it comes to solving computational problems - or, rather, any problem that requires computation. Much of modern computing is concerned with [high dimensional arrays](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tensors); [vector processing](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/representation/word2vec); doing [parallel processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing); and dealing with [large data sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data). These are all areas where array thinking is incredibly useful.\n",
